          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="1">Game Development</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Game Development is exactly what is sounds like; it is the
            <b class="super-important">process of creating games.</b> This process includes designing the
            <b>mechanics, generation, art, and the release.</b> Game Developers must work together to design a game.
            They always <b>test</b> to make sure that the game is <b>functioning properly.</b>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="2">Types of Game Developers</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            There are <b class="super-important">many different types of game developers.</b> Each of them works on the
            <b>different components of a game.</b> Below listed are some examples of game developers, but are not all of
            them.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="3">Game Designers</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Game designers handle the <b class="super-important">elements of the game,</b> which includes storylines,
            rules, and challenges. Game design is a <b>collaborative process</b> where a person can also
            <b>fill another role.</b> It also involves <b>working out the game play</b> and show the concept to
            publishers.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="4">Game Artist</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Game artists are often animators and/or three-dimensional modelers who create
            <b class="super-important">two-dimensional and three dimensional art</b> for video games. They work on all
            of the <b>visual elements to form the game</b>, which includes the characters, objects, and environments.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="5">Sound Engineer</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Sound enginners are in <b class="super-important">control of the sound</b> of the game. Sound is an
            <b>important aspect of games</b> because it <b>influences a player's emotions</b> and add excitement to the
            game.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="6">Game Programmer</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Game progrmmers <b class="super-important">write code that makes the game playable</b> on all devices. They
            are responsible of <b>creating gaming software</b>, establishing artwork into the game and deciding
            <b>how users will access and interact with the game.</b>
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="7">Game Level Designer</h3>
          <p>
            Level designers <b class="super-important">design the levels of games</b> and make sure that they are
            <b>entertaining to the user.</b> They ensure that each stage engages the user, while also
            <b>deciding on the difficulty</b> of each level.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="8">Game Tester</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Game testers <b class="super-important">play the game many times to ensure quality</b> and user-friendliness
            of the game. If there is any <b>improvements and bugs</b> that the game testers find, they will
            <b>report it</b> to the team and offer feedback.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="9">Game Producer</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Game producers <b class="super-important">maintain the development team</b> and the production schedule.
            They are responsible for the <b>budget, contracts, marketing,</b> and informing the team of
            <b>production deadlines.</b>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="10">Game Engines</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Game Developers need to be able to
            <b class="super-important">use game engines</b> to be able to <b>create components more efficiently</b>,
            because they provide lots of <b>pre-made functions and features.</b> Some of the engines are so advanced
            that people with no programming skills can build a game from scratch, which makes
            <b>game development accessible to almost everyone.</b> Typical game engines include CryEngine, Unreal
            Engine, Unity Game Engine, and more.
          </p>

          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="11">Game Developer Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            Game developers need to be able to
            <b class="super-important">up with ideas and implement these ideas into code</b> , while reviewing and
            making improvements. They need to <b>collaborate with other people</b> in their team. They must also decide
            what <b>tool to use to solve a problem</b>, and <b>how to use that tool.</b>
