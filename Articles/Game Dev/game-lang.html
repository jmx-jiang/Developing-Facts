          Are you looking for a job in <a href="./game.html">game-development</a>, but don't know what languages to
          learn? This article will give you languages and engines for game-development, but note that there are
          <b>many other choices out there.</b> I limited this article to
          <b>good options.</b>
          There is
          <b class="super-important">no such thing as a tool being "outclassed"</b>
          because it really depends on various factors like the project requirements.

        <h2>Languages</h2>

        <h3 id="1" class="light-toggled">1. C++</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          C++ is ranked number one because of its <b class="super-important">high-performance and flexibility.</b> It is
          statically typed and compiled, making it very <b>fast and efficient in memory-management.</b> The speed is
          especially important, as people who play games don't want to wait long for something to load. C++ can also
          <b>control graphic processing and hardware,</b> a necessity of complex and high-performance games. C++ is also
          an <b>object-oriented</b> programming language, which means that the programmer can
          <b>easily organize and reuse code.</b> The only problem with C++ is that it is <b>difficult to learn.</b>
        </p>

        <h3 id="2" class="light-toggled">2. C#</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          C# is popular because of its close <b class="super-important">relationship to Unity,</b> one of the best game
          engines available. Like C++, C# is also <b>object-oriented and statically typed.</b> It being statically typed
          means that the <b>data type of an object is secured</b> and decreases the probability of run-time errors.
          Unlike C++, C# is <b>simple and readable,</b> which means that you don't have to worry too much on complex
          technical details. C# features many <b>libraries and tools</b> for creating applications.
        </p>

        <h3 id="3" class="light-toggled">3. JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          JavaScript (not to be confused with Java) is more for the web, but it can also be used for games, due to its
          <b class="super-important">high versatility</b> (like C++ and C#). Unlike C++ and C#, JavaScript is
          <b>interpreted</b>, along with being <b>dynamically and loosely typed</b> (the opposite of C++ and C#, as they
          are compiled, statically and strongly typed). JavaScript being dynamically typed means that you can
          <b>write code quicker,</b> but the programmer needs to look out for typing errors. JavaScript is also
          <b>readable with its asynchronous code</b> (meaning that another event can start before the previous event
          ends). This is important for handling requests. JavaScript <b>runs on any broswer.</b>
        </p>

        <h3 id="4" class="light-toggled">4. Java</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Java (not to be confused with JavaScript) is also capable of game-development. Although not as great as C++
          and C#, Java can <b class="super-important">run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine</b> (JVM). It
          supports WORA <b>(Write Once, Run Anywhere).</b> This makes Java stand out compare to other programming
          languages. It supports game-development on <b>multiple platforms.</b> Java also supports OOP
          <b>(Object Oriented Programming)</b> like the programming languages mentioned above. Java also offers socket
          programming, which makes it <b>convenient to build multiplayer games</b> with its servers. Also, Java has a
          <b>thriving community</b> of developers who can help.

        <h2 class="light-toggled">Engines</h2>

        <h3 class="light-toggled" id="5">1. Unreal Engine</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Unreal Engine is one of the top game engines. With Unreal Engine, it can modify games to create
          <b>unique experiences.</b> Unreal Engine is a <b>3D engine that requires no code,</b> with the
          <b>best graphics</b>
          engine. However, this means that you <b>need a powerful computer</b> to use these graphics. Its graphical
          capabilities make it used in many games today. While it can also be a 2D engine, there are better options for
          that. This engine is also capable of <b>handling complex tasks efficiently.</b> This already great engine is
          <b>still being improved</b> by the community. You don't even have to know any programmming languages.
          According to some game-developers, Unreal Engine is best for large projects to be created in a team.
        </p>

        <h3 class="light-toggled" id="6">2. Unity</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Unity is also one of the top game engines. It
          <b class="super-important">supports many platforms,</b> including PC, consoles, and mobile. Unity's free
          version already has the <b>essential features to get started,</b> while allowing developers to create scripts
          and plugins. Unlike Unreal Engine, <b>Unity is great for both 2D and 3D games.</b> A review reported that
          “Unity is my go-to game engine for both 2D and 3D game development. The
          <b>flexibility and extensibility</b>
          of Unity allow me to create <b>unique gameplay mechanics,</b> and the
          <b>wide range of platform support</b> makes it easy to reach a larger audience.” - Sarah, Indie Game
          Developer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="light-toggled" id="7">3. GameMaker Studio</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          GameMaker Studio stands out because it is
          <b class="super-important">extremely easy to use, without any programming experience.</b> With GameMaker
          Studio, you can <b>"drag-and-drop"</b> your game instead of writing code. However, this means that GameMaker
          Studio is <b>limited in the types of games it can make.</b> GameMaker is <b>best used for 2D games</b>; some
          games that were created with GameMaker Studio include <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Spelunky.</em>
        </p>

        <h3 class="light-toggled" id="8">4. Godot</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Godot is an <b class="super-important">open-source and free</b> for developers to use. It is capable of
          building <b>2D games and simple 3D games.</b> While not as old as the other engines listed above, there is
          still a <b>great community</b> that supports it, with <b>plenty of tools to use.</b> Godot also supports
          multiple platforms.
