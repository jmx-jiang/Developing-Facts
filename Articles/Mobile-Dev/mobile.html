          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="1">What is Mobile Development</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Like other development paths, mobile development is exactly what it sounds like. It's a field where mobile
            developers <b class="super-important">write software that creates apps on mobile.</b> Mobile devices are
            small and they include phones and iPads. Mobile developers need to know what the
            <b>app's purpose, its looks, programming it, testing for errors, and finally publishing it.</b>
            Mobile development is spreading throughout the world due to the <b>popularity of mobile devices.</b>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="2">Types of Mobile Development</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Like other fields of development, there are
            <b class="super-important">specific branches of mobile development.</b> Below indented are <b>four</b> main
            catagories of mobile development.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="3">iOS Development</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            iOS Development corresponds to
            <b class="super-important">creating apps with Apple's iOS operating system.</b> This system power iPhones
            and iPods. iOS developers usually use languages like <b>Swift and Objective-C</b> to create their apps.
            These tools are capable of creating great <b>user experience and complex components</b> of the app.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="4">Andorid Development</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Android Developers are responsible for
            <b class="super-important">creting mobile apps with Google's Android operating system.</b> This system
            allows developers to create <b>many types of apps</b> for Android devices. The most used programming
            languages for this field are <b>Java and Kotlin.</b> To write code in these languages, Android developers
            need an <b>integrated development environment (IDE).</b> The <b>official IDE</b> for Android development is
            <b>Android Studio.</b> Android Studio's advanced tools for designing, coding, and testing make it very
            <b>popular.</b>
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="5">Cross-Platform Mobile Development</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Cross-Platform Mobile Developers <b class="super-important">create muti-platform apps.</b> They use
            frameworks (especially <b>React Native and Flutter</b>) to design and program these apps. These frameworks
            also ensure that these <b>apps are native on all platforms.</b> Cross-platform development also allows
            developers to share code, which follows <b>WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere).</b>
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="6">Mobile Game Developer</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Mobile Game Developers<b class="super-important">create games on mobile devices.</b> Like traditional game
            developers, they also use <b>game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine</b> (<a
              href="../Game Dev/game-lang.html"
              >click here for more information</a
            >). Mobile Game Developers need to be establish the <b>game mechanics, characters, storylines, etc.</b> as
            well as tweaking with the game functionality through <b>programming.</b> They must test the game for errors,
            and update the game frequently to keep the users playing.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="7">Mobile App UI/UX Developer</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            UI/UX developers design the <b class="super-important">user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)</b> of
            mobile apps. They are in charge of <b>application's architecture,</b> layout, structure, and responsiveness.
            They ensure <b>visual appeal and user-friendliness</b> of the application. They do this with the
            <b>design principles,</b> which are the rules for great user interface. They also come up with the
            <b>requirements for the design</b> of the application, and implement and test, and check for errors or
            possible improvements. There are <b>many tools</b> that are capble of UI and UX, which these developers use.
          </p>

          <h3 class="light-toggled" id="8">Mobile Backend Developer</h3>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Backend developers are responsible for the <b class="super-important">behind-the-scenes</b> of a mobile app,
            which include <b>databases and logic.</b> They program the <b>interactivity</b> and data handling, as well
            as creating <b>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</b> which allows apps to access the server. They
            also configure a database, which secures and stores data. Mobile Backend Developers need to know
            <b>server-side languages</b> (this includes Java and Python) and a <b>database language</b> (this includes
            SQL and NoSQL). This role is necessary for creating mobile apps due to the functionality needed.
