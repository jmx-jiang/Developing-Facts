        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="1">Why should you be a web developer?</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Web development <b class="super-important">combines creativity with analysis.</b> As a web developer, there
          are <b>many opportunities to learn more about the languages you use.</b> Skilled web developers are high in
          demand, with a great salary. It is recommended that you check out what is
          <a href="./web.html">web development</a> before you read more.

      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="2">Understand the Internet</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          First, you should know how the internet works.
          <b class="super-important">Websites are files with code that is in the server</b>, which
          <b>links to the internet.</b> To access a website, you need to <b>load it thorugh a browser</b> (client). To
          see how this works, when you click on a link, the browser sends a
          <b>request to a website and finds the file.</b>
          Then, the <b>server receives the request and sends the file back.</b> The client-side is the front-end, and
          the server-side is the back-end.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="3">Text Editor</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          It is a must-have to use a <b class="super-important">text editor to write code.</b> There are many text
          editors out there, which makes it difficult to select one. Ideally, you should
          <b>choose one that makes it easy to write code and best suits your prefrence.</b> I like to use
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> because it is a fast and
          efficient cross-platform editor with great debugging support.

      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="4">Front-end Languages</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          It is important to choose the right languages to learn. The first language you should learn is
          <b class="super-important">HTML</b>, which is used to <b>structure a website.</b> Then you should learn
          <b class="super-important">CSS</b>, which <b>styles a website.</b> You should also learn its
          <b>frameworks, like Bootstrap.</b> Then you should learn <b class="super-important">JavaScript</b>, which
          <b>programs the website.</b> It is highly recommended to <b>tackle these languages in the order</b> I said
          them, since they build on each other that way. For more information,
          <a href="./web_languages.html">click here.</a>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="5">JavaScript Frameworks</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          <b class="super-important">JavaScript frameworks are libraries of pre-written code for common tasks.</b> It
          helps do a lot of <b>common things easier</b>, so you don't have to start from scratch. You can build
          animations easily without doing it yourself. However, JavaScript has tons of frameworks to choose from, so it
          can be tough to choose. <b>Popular frameworks include Node.js, jQuery, Express.js, and React.</b> For more
          information,

      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="6">Servers</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Now, we are focusing on the back-end. Servers are responsible for
          <b class="super-important">accepting and sending requests over the internet.</b>
          They are computers that <b>store a website's files.</b> Back-end developers are familiar with servers and are
          able to manage them. One type of server is a <b class="super-important">centralized server</b>, which
          <b>stores all of its information in one place.</b> It makes it easier to control how to store and access the
          data. But today, many companies use <b class="super-important">serverless hosting.</b> It doesn't mean that
          there is no server; it means that <b>developers are not responsible for maintaining the server.</b> This
          method is cheap and fast, which is why most companies use it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="7">Databases</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          <b class="super-important">Back-end developers need to know how to manage and access data.</b> Structured
          Query Language <b>(SQL) is a query language used to create databases</b>, add data into databases, and change
          it. SQL can also query data from relational databases, where data is organized into tables. There are also
          <b>NoSQL databases, which are not structured in tables and are more flexible.</b> This type of database is
          used for large amounts of data.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="8">Back-end Languages</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          There are many programming languages and frameworks for the back-end, so it is important to
          <b>choose the ones that are still being used.</b> Some popular ones include
          <b class="super-important">Python</b> (especially <b>Django and Flask</b>),
          <b class="super-important">Node.js</b>, and <b class="super-important">SQL</b> (<b>especially MySQL</b>). You
          can learn these in any order. Note that the
          <b>right back-end languages depends on the project requirements</b>, so there is no really right answer to the
          best back-end language. For more information,

      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="9">Web Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          <b class="super-important">Web architecture is the layout and strcuture</b> of pages in a website. Web
          developers need to predict what the <b>users want to do</b>, what type of users will come, where the users are
          coming from, and how will they <b>navigate the website</b>. Web developers have to make sure that the
          <b>architecture and design is appealing to the users</b> and the <b>layout is organized.</b> The color and
          font matters too. Colors can affect user impression and fonts say things about your website.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="10">Responsive Design</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          There are lots of devices today, which include phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. Their sizes are very
          different, and your <b class="super-important">website needs to respond to the size of the device.</b> For
          example, on <b>smaller screens, the menu will be a button</b>, which will have to be clicked to acess its
          content. On <b>bigger screens</b> the menu button will not be there and instead, its
          <b>content will be arranged horizontally</b> on the top.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="light-toggled" id="11">How to Learn Web Development</h2>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Learning all of the concepts above might sound overwhelming, so it is recommended to
          <b>set a goal and a timeline.</b> You should also take a
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">bootcamp</a>
          <b>to help you structure your learning.</b> But to get a job, it is highly recommended to
          <b class="super-important">create a portfolio</b> of
          <a href="https://arc.dev/developer-blog/web-developer-portfolio/" target="_blank">projects</a> you made. This
          shows that you are capable for the job. A good portfolio is a lot more important than a degree.
