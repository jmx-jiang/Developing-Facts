          Are you looking for a job in <a href="./web.html">web-development</a>, but don't know what languages to learn?
          This article will give you languages for web-development, but note that there are
          <b>many other languages/frameworks out there.</b> I limited this article to
          <b>seven languages/frameworks for the front-end and the back-end,</b>
          which makes fourteen sections in total. There is
          <b class="super-important">no such thing as a language being "outclassed"</b>
          because it really depends on various factors like the project requirements.

        <h2 class="light-toggled">Front-End Languages</h2>

        <h3 id="1" class="light-toggled">1. HTML</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup langauge that
          <b class="super-important">designs the structure of a web page</b>, including links, text, side-bars, and
          more. <b>HTML is required to learn for web-development</b> because of this. HTML has received many updates,
          with the <b>latest version being HTML5.</b> HTML is easy to use, learn, and its syntax is easy to understand.
          However, knowing only HTML will make websites lack in user-expierence and fuctionality, so web-developers also
          need to know CSS and javascript for the front-end.

        </p>

        <h3 id="2" class="light-toggled">2. CSS</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language that
          <b class="super-important">styles a website</b>, <b>allowing the control of how HTML elements look</b> in the
          web, like the font-size and the background color. <b>CSS is required to learn for web-development</b> because
          it allows you to <b>create websites that look great</b> - without it, websites won't look that great. CSS has
          recieved various updates, with the <b>latest being CSS3.</b> CSS has a variety of frameworks, with the most
          popular one being Bootstrap. CSS is relatively easy to learn.

        </p>

        <h3 id="3" class="light-toggled">3. JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          JavaScript is a scripting language, on a higher level of complexity than HTML and CSS. In order to make great
          websites, you need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all together. JavaScript
          <b class="super-important">allows the use of animation</b> and can <b>change the CSS settings</b>,
          <b class="super-important">infecting the interface of the website.</b>
          For example, HTML can create a button, CSS can make it blue, but JavaScript is the reason why the button does
          something. Like HTML and CSS, JavaScript had recent updates, with the
          <b>most recent one being ECMAScript 2019</b>. JavaScript has a <b>big set of liberies</b>, like NodeJS, which
          can be used for back-end (server-side).

        </p>

        <h3 id="4" class="light-toggled">4. React</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          React is an <b>front-end JavaScript library</b> developed by Meta to
          <b class="super-important">create interactive user interfaces (UI).</b>
          With React, you can create UI parts and make better control of applications. Its reusable structure
          <b>allows developers can make more complex applications</b>, with fast UI powered by a rendering engine. React
          makes the development process easier by making a more <b>organized and strutured user interfaces.</b> React is
          one out of the many JavaScript liberies out there, so there are more frameworks to choose from, including for
          web-development.

        <h3 id="5" class="light-toggled">5. Vue</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Vue is a JavaScript framework developed by Evan You that is
          <b class="super-important">used to make UI and one-page applications.</b>
          Vue is popular because of the
          <b>simplicity, flexibility, and high preformance</b>, allowing reusable components. Vue allows developers to
          build components in a flexible way, improving code organization, as well as typing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
          code. Vue has
          <b>thriving libraries, tools, and plugins with documentation and people.</b>
          Because of Vue's learning curve, it is a popular starter, despite other frameworks. More people are using it
          as time goes on, making Vue the
          <b>second most popular JavaScript framework</b> out there.

        <h3 id="6" class="light-toggled">6. Angular</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Angular is another JavaScript framework developed by Google,
          <b>widely used by devleopers </b>in the front-end community. It is used for one-page applications. Angular has
          <b>tools for maintainable applications with a modular structure, making code maintainable.</b>
          With Angular,
          <b class="super-important">developers can make UI parts and manage applications</b>
          in an organized way, including features for testing applications. However, despite making a good front-end
          framework, Angular has a
          <b>steep learning path and performance issues.</b>

        <h3 id="7" class="light-toggled">7. Swift</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Swift is a compiled programming language
          <b
            >devleoped by Apple. This languges aims for readabilty, efficiency, security, fast preformance, and
            simplicity</b
          >, making it an
          <b class="super-important">excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers to make applications.</b>
          Swift's development process is rapid and makes it easier to control the application and the group. Swift is
          backed up by tech companies, being
          <b>in demand and is growing fast.</b> It has an <b>open community to help</b> as well. However, Swift is
          <b>small compared to other languages</b>, making it difficult for finding devlopers for a Swift project.

        <h3 id="8" class="light-toggled">1. JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          <b class="super-important">JavaScript is not only a front-end language but also a back-end language.</b>
          This makes the learning curve shorter and is why JavaScript is known as the
          <b>"Programming Language of the Web."</b> It is the most popular language in the world of tech. Node.js, a
          popular JavaScript environment for back-end, has increased in usage, which also made JavaScript more popular
          as a back-end language. JavaScript is easy to set up and has a <b>thriving community</b> of expert developers.
          It has <b>simple scripting syntax and features</b> that allow JavaScript programs to connect information.
          JavaScript is a
          <b>dynamically typed lannguage that supports object-oriented programming.</b>
          This is just a few of many features of JavaScript that make it the "king."

        <h3 id="9" class="light-toggled">2. Python</h3>
        <p class="light-toggled">
          Python is a general-purpose programming language
          <b>designed to be simple to learn and readable</b>, by limiting the amount of code lines and rules to follow.
          Python covers a lot of branches of Computer Science, including Machine Leanring, Data Science, and
          Web-Development. It is <b>widely used with a large community.</b> The primary reason why Python is used for
          Web-Development is because Python
          <b class="super-important">has a enormous collection of libraries to make work easier and efficent.</b>
          The two popular
          <b class="super-important">frameworks for back-end-web-development are Flask and Django.</b>
          Python is used by a whole range of companies and websites, being one of the main languages used by Google.
          Like JavaScript, there are so many reasons why developers like to use Python.
          <b>Python's growth increased rapidly during the past years, and will comtinue growing.</b>

          SQL (Structured Query Language)
          <b class="super-important">employs queries to get information from databases.</b>
          It is the
          <b class="super-important">main language for database management.</b>
          SQL can change the performance of the back-end in a reliable way. SQL's features and syntax can
          <b>handle large datasets.</b> The back-end requires databases like SQLite and MySQL. SQL can handle with a lot
          of data,
          <b>ensuring that data is secure and does not have any problems.</b>
          SQL is fast because it can go through data quickly. SQL has features like data encryption to keep data safe.

        <p class="light-toggled">
          PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a scripting language, so the code interpreted by the computer. PHP is used for
          server-side and it
          <b class="super-important">makes publishing code easier with its deployment tools.</b>
          PHP is useful for devleopment becaused it can be
          <b>embeded into HTML.</b> PHP also helps devlopers <b>see results for their code,</b> ingnoring minor error
          that does not change the result of a program. That can be helpful, but makes it
          <b>important for careful editing and testing to make sure that the results are accurate.</b>
          However, PHP has limited debugging tools, making code
          <b>harder to debug.</b> PHP is also <b>unsecure,</b> making the program's result less accurate.
