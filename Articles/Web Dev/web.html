          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="1">What is Web Devleopment?</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Web Development is the process of <b class="super-important">creating and maintaining a website.</b> Web
            Developers try to <b>bring their ideas to life by designing a website</b>. There are three types of web
            development, <b>front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development.</b> These concepts
            will be covered in the next headings.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="2">Front-End Development</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            <b class="super-important">Front-end developers create the interface of websites</b>, such as fonts and
            colors. They control what the website does and looks like and determines how the web designer's concepts
            display. Front-end devleopers need to know languages like <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> to create
            appealing websites for users.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="3">Back-End Development</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            <b class="super-important">Back-End Development controls the server-side software</b>, which happens
            behind-the-scenes. They control the databases, logic, application programming interface, and servers. They
            need to display that data on the website's front-end. They need to
            <b>make sure that the server is efficient and fast, with high-quality performance.</b>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="4">What is Full-Stack Development?</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Full Stack Developers are
            <b class="super-important">responsible on both the front-end and back-end of a website.</b> They can design
            web services and interfaces and product features on all platforms. Full-stack developers always use many
            technologies to design thier website. Because full-stack development handles both the front-end anc
            back-end, they are a <b>lot higher in demand and are paid more for greater responsibility.</b> The average
            salary for full-stack developers in the United States is $147,280.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="5">Full Stack Developer Skills</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            Having a big responsibility means that they must be able to
            <b class="super-important">fix bugs and communicate with other devleopers.</b> There is a huge community of
            full stack devleopers, with advancing technology creating more and more possible ideas to create. This means
            that full stack developers need to <b>know the right technology to make various projects.</b> Full Stack
            Devleopers also need to be <b>creative, know how to use technology, and have attention to detail.</b> If you
            want to know what languages you should learn for full stack web devleopment,

        <section>
          <h2 class="light-toggled" id="6">Web Development vs. Web Design</h2>
          <p class="light-toggled">
            <b class="super-important">Web designers create how the website looks</b>, like images, links, menus. It
            <b class="super-important">controls the site's usability and layout</b>. They want to create a visually
            <b>appealing website.</b> Great web design is necessary for great user experience. Since web designers are
            focused on the visuals of a website, they usually design logos, format, color paletts, and much more.<br /><br />Web
            devleopers, on the other hand, <b class="super-important">work on the function of the website.</b> The make
            sure the website is functioning correctly and the <b>ideas are implemented correctly</b> on the website. As
            discussed on the previous paragraphs, there are two types of web development, front-end and back-end. Web
            designers and web developers have some common roles, so it is possible to find developers who can handle
            both.
